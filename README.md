This repository serves as my Case study solution for the Instagram Mock Database SQL Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the Udemy course: [The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) by Colt Steele.

It showcases my competancy to tackle various SQL challenges and demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills.

A special thanks to [Colt Steele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) for creating this engaging SQL Bootcamp.
